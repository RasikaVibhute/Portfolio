# Rasika Vibhute - Data Analyst Portfolio
# About
Hi, I am Rasika Vipin Vibhute, a Masterâ€™s student in Data Analytics & Decision Science, with 4 years of professional experience in data analysis and digital transformation. I am currently seeking an internship where I can apply my technical expertise and analytical mindset to solve real-world problems at the intersection of data, technology, and business strategy.

Throughout my career and academic journey, I have built a strong foundation in machine learning, predictive and optimization modeling, and data-driven decision making. I work fluently with Python, R, and SQL, and I enjoy translating data into actionable insights through Power BI visualizations.

This repository showcases my coding skills and applied projects using freely available datasets.

Feel free to explore, and check out my CV for more details.
