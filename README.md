# Rasika Vibhute - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About
Hi, I am Rasika Vipin Vibhute, a Masterâ€™s student in Data Analytics & Decision Science, with 4 years of professional experience in data analysis and digital transformation. I am currently seeking an internship where I can apply my technical expertise and analytical mindset to solve real-world problems at the intersection of data, technology, and business strategy.

Throughout my career and academic journey, I have built a strong foundation in machine learning, predictive and optimization modeling, and data-driven decision making. I work fluently with Python, R, and SQL, and I enjoy translating data into actionable insights through Power BI visualizations.

This repository showcases my coding skills and applied projects using freely available datasets.

Feel free to explore, and check out my [CV](https://github.com/RasikaVibhute/Portfolio/blob/main/Rasika%20Vibhute%20CV.pdf) for more details.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section, I have listed data analytics projects with brief descriptions of the problems addressed and the technology stack used to solve them.

### Python
### a. Predicting coupon acceptance based on driving context
**Code:** [Predicting coupon acceptance based on driving context.ipynb](https://github.com/RasikaVibhute/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Predicting%20coupon%20acceptance%20based%20on%20driving%20context.ipynb)

**Goal:** To predict whether a person will accept a coupon based on their demographic information, preferences, and driving scenario context.

**Description:** This project applies machine learning techniques to a real-world dataset involving personalized coupon recommendations. The objective is to understand the factors that influence coupon acceptance behavior while driving (e.g., time, location, companion, weather).

**Skills:** Exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, classification modeling, model evaluation, decision tree visualization.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

**Results:** Considering the performance across all metrics, Linear SVC emerges as the best model for this classification task. Linear SVC's higher precision and balanced recall make it a reliable choice, especially when misclassification costs are equally weighted.
